# Real Estate Web Application - MERN Stack - NOVA ESTATE

This project is a comprehensive real estate web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The primary goal was to create a user-friendly platform for property owners to showcase their listings while offering an engaging browsing experience for potential buyers.

## Key Features

- **Property Listing Management**: Users can effortlessly list their properties with detailed information and upload up to six images per listing, providing a comprehensive view for potential buyers.
- **User Authentication and Profile Management**: Google Authentication via Firebase ensures secure user registration and login. Users can manage their profiles, edit information, and track their listed properties.
- **Intuitive UI/UX**: The frontend, built with React TypeScript, features Material Tailwind and FontAwesome for aesthetic enhancements and Framer Motion for visually appealing animations, delivering an interactive and visually captivating experience.
- **State Management and Security**: Redux is employed for state persistence, ensuring smooth interactions and seamless browsing. Backend functionalities powered by Express.js and Node.js incorporate bcryptjs for enhanced security, JWT for authentication, and MongoDB for efficient database management.
